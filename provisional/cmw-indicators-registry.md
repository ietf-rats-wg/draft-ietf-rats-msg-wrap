# RATS Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW) Indicators **PROVISIONAL** Registry

This page acts as a provisional registry for CMW Indicators values.

This page will be active until [draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap/) is published.

At (or around) that time, its contents will be handed over to IANA and the page will be deleted.

To add new indicators, create a PR that adds the message name and the associated codepoint to the table below, adjusting the "Unassigned" range accordingly. 

For rationale about how to pick names and codepoints, see [Section 8.4 of draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap-04.html#section-8.4).

| Indicator value |	Conceptual Message name	|
